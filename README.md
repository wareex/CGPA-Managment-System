This mini-project is entitled Cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) website. It is a web application that was mainly developed using PHP Language and SQLite Database.

How does the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) Calculator work?
The Grade Point Average (GPA) Calculator is a simple web application that calculates the students' GPA per semester and aggregates the CGPA of each student base on previous semester GPA. The users can dynamically manage the Grade Table as the reference of the grade scale and letters such as (5.0) as the scale and (A+) as the grade letter. Users can simply update the table by providing the required input fields in each table row which consist of Letter Grade, Grade Point, and Credit Unit fields. Unlike the GPA the computed or generated CGPA data of the student do not store in the database but the user can directly print the record to have a copy.
